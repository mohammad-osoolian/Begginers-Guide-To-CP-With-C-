# Begginers Guide To CP With C++
This is a 10 pages guide I've written for those who want to start Competitive Programming(CP) with C++ which is the most common language among CP competitors.

This guide is written in LaTeX and I learned LaTeX through it. Download the pdf file if you want to read the guide and clone the repository if you want to see my LaTex codes.
